# Illuminating the dark side of statistics: Bayesian inference in particle physics

High energy physics (HEP) has historically favoured frequentist statistical methodologies, leading to the development of analysis workflows and tools optimized around this paradigm. Frequentist techniques often utilizes asymptotic approximations for efficient parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. While these methods are highly effective, their assumptions may restrict flexibility in certain analyses, especially when asymptotic approximations break down or simply do not apply.

Bayesian approaches are gaining traction in HEP due to their interpretative advantages, offering the full posterior distribution over parameter spaces and enabling flexible inference, even in scenarios where asymptotic approximations break down.

We will explore the fundamental differences between Bayesian and frequentist inference and examine the conditions under which these distinctions truly matter. Most importantly, we will discuss the foundations that are essential to any analysis, regardless of the chosen statistical framework.
